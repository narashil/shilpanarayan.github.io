								<h2>Data Science Projects</h2>
								<p> <b>>> <a href="https://narashil.github.io/ml_alg_comparison.html" target="_blank">Machine Learning Model Comparison</a></b><br>
									Developed and implemented five ML models (Logistic, KNN, Random Forest, Linear SVC, SVM) using scikit-learn
									to classify blue tarps and rescue earthquake survivors. Automated the implementation to find optimal F1-score
									threshold based on precision-recall curve and determine cost tradeoff between false positives and false negatives.
									Conducted hyperparameter tuning and cross validation using pipelines and grid search to find the optimal parameters.
									Finally compared various classification metrics such as accuracy, log-loss, precision, recall and run-time to choose
									the optimal algorithm.<br>
									 <b>>> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lv6UiBIuyJBrWyNjmHzuynsWkBKosBuC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
										Network analysis for impact of python packages (Using python NetworkX)</a></b>
									Contributed to a NSF grant to measure the impact of open source software. Identified influential actors, e.g.,
									packages, developers, countries by using the impact measures. Used network-based statistics include centrality
									measures such as degree, and eigenvector centrality. Moreover, we calculate the cost of software development and
									study the relationship between development cost and impact of Python projects. <br>
									<b>>>  <a href="https://narashil.github.io/Predicting%20Educ%20Level%20Using%20Census%20Data_Code.html"  target="_blank">
										Predicting Education Level Using US Census Data</a></b>
									Implemented a Random Forest ML model in PySpark to predict education level for a resident based on various
									household characteristics. Used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions and identify the most
									contributing predictors. Optimized the runtime by using graph based cross validation methods in PySpark.<br>
									>> <b>Course Recommendation System (Using Neural Collaborative Filtering–not public)</b> <br>
									Developed a model to help administrators to recommend courses as electives to students

								<br>University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA</b> 
								
							<p>>> Led a cross-functional team of four to transform equity metrics into an insightful dashboard using Qlik Sense
								<br>
								>> Deployed a NLP based Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to summarize thousands of course evaluations and climate
								survey data of students and provide insights to administrators to improve teaching and learning strategies
								<br>
								>> Designed a predictive model using Imbalanced Random Forest to identify underserved students using US
								Census data to increase their enrollment at UVA
								<br>
								>> Created data pipelines for automating collection, transformation and aggregation of thousands of student/staff climate
								survey results using python
								<br>
								>> Developed various student dashboards using python and Qlik Sense such as student success to identify
								DFW rates, attrition and completion rates, persistence dashboards which helped department Chairs track students’
